# Windows Azure Web Sites (PaaS) #

## Demo ##

### Introduction ###

Demos are sets of step-by-step guides that are designed to help you learn how to use key Windows Azure services and features. Each demo provides instructions to guide you through the process of developing a complete application.

This demo demonstrates how to use Microsoft WebMatrix 2 to quickly build and publish Web sites in Windows Azure. You do not need to be a developer in order to do this and it will help to illustrate the difference between Windows Azure IaaS and PaaS as well as show you one of the many non-IaaS services available on Windows Azure.
